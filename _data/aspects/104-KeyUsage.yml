description: >
  This aspect covers the use of cryptographic [keys](#key) and/or [seeds](#seed) to ensure they are used in a secure manner that minimizes the risks to the confidentiality of private keys and integrity of funds. This section does not cover the usage of key backups which are only used in the event the primary key is lost/damaged/inaccessible. A variety of risks are present when using keys that can lead to the loss of funds including dirty signature vulnerabilities (i.e. re-used 'R' values), opportunity for malware to copy or modify keys, and malicious insiders who use their authorized access to send unauthorized transactions.

level_one:
  - Access to the primary [key](#key)/[seed](#seed) requires an identifier (e.g. username, email, GUID, etc.) and at least 2 (two) other [factors of authentication](#authentication-factor), which restricts access to the authorized operator. Examples of additional factors of authentication include Google Authenticator tokens, digital signatures from a private key, in-person ID verification, possession of a physical key or token, or a countersigning organization who can remotely attest to the authenticity of the key holder.
  - All [keys](#key)/[seeds](#seed) are only used in [trusted environments](#trusted-environment). This somewhat reduces the risk of unauthorized copies being made by malware, as well as mitigating the risk of storing (even inadvertently) a key on a machine, allowing it to be recovered by another user or intruder. An effective trusted environment guards against unauthorized persons learning private keys, passwords, or other sensitive information.
  - All [key](#key)/[seed](#seed)-holders have had their references checked prior to being trusted to hold one of the organization’s keys/seeds. This helps ensure the person is being truthful about their past and were not dismissed from prior employment for reasons that would represent a risk to the organization.
  - All [key](#key)/[seed](#seed)-holders (individuals and organizations) have undergone [identity verification](#identity-verification) to ensure they are who they say they are. This reduces the risks associated with impersonation and social engineering attacks which may result in access to organizational or customer funds.
  - No two [master keys](#key)/[seeds](#seed) of the same [multi-signature](#multisig) wallet are ever present on the same device. Placing two keys of the same wallet on a single device exposes the keys to information leakage by either a malicious operator or malicious software. Ensuring every key of a wallet is used on dedicated devices reduces these risks, thereby increasing security.
  - Digital [signatures](#signature) must use a 'k' value that is never repeated. This can be accomplished through the use of a [deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)](#drbg) that is compliant with [NIST SP 800-90A](http://http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf), or a deterministic scheme compatible with [RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979). Using strong sources of [entropy](#entropy) is required in order to prevent "dirty signature" vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to recover the private key that was used to compute the signature. A common implementation of this is to use the [pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)](#prng) supplied by popular operating systems, or an RFC 6979-compatible scheme.

level_two:
  - Verification of fund destinations and amounts is performed via a [Authenticated Communication Channel](#authenticated-communication-channel) prior to [key](#key)/[seed](#seed) use. This can be performed by humans before using their keys/seeds to ensure they’re sending the right amount of funds to the right [addresses](#address)/people/companies, or by systems that perform automated signing by checking destination addresses against whitelists and spending limits before the signature is applied. The implementation of payment protocols that provide [digitally signed](#signature) addresses, or the use of systems that display images and business names instead of cryptocurrency addresses greatly simplify this verification process.

level_three:
  - Access to the [key](#key)/[seed](#seed) requires an identifier (e.g. username, email, GUID, etc.) and at least 3 (three) other [factors of authentication](#authentication-factor). Similar to the requirement of 2 additional factors in Level I, the other 3 factors of authentication in Level III can take any form that provides confirmation of an authorized user's identity.
  - All individual [key](#key)/[seed](#seed) holders have had background checks performed by law enforcement personnel or investigative firms. This ensures each key/seed holder is who they say they are and does not have evidence in their past of actions that would represent a risk to the organization if they had signing authority on organization or user funds.
