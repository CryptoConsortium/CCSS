title: Key / Seed Generation

description: >
 This aspect covers the generation of [cryptographic keys](#key) and [seeds](#seed) that will be used within a cryptocurrency system. The secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds requires two things to be secure: confidentiality and un-guessable numbers. Confidentiality is required to ensure that the newly created keys or seeds are not read/copied by an unintended party. Un-guessable numbers are required to ensure the newly created key cannot be guessed or determined by an unintended party. Each of the goals listed below provide assurance that the keys and/or seeds are created in a confidential and un-guessable manner.

level_one:
  - The [cryptographic keys](#key) and [seeds](#seed) are created by the [actor](#actor) who will be using it. This is an attempt to protect the confidentiality of the key. Any system that requires one actor to transfer a key or seed to another actor after generating it will fail to achieve Level I.
  - Notably, transferring a cryptographic secret for backup purposes does not violate the above requirement, however those secrets must be transmitted and stored in a [strongly encrypted](#strong-encryption) format.

level_two:
  - The [key](#key) or [seed](#seed) generation methodology is validated prior to use. Software that is used to generate seeds should be free from any features that restrict the generated seed to conform to deterministic values and features that store or transmit the generated seed to another [actor](#actor), except where such features enhance the effective security of the software (e.g. [DRBGs](#drbg)).
  - After software has been audited, a digital signature should be generated and and published. The signature should be validated prior to each execution to ensure the software has not been altered since it passed its security audit.
  - In cases where keys or seeds are created without the use of software (e.g. dice, a deck of cards, or other non-digital source of [entropy](#entropy)), the creation methodology should be validated to ensure determinism is not present (i.e. there are no weighted dice, each card in the deck is unique, etc.).

level_three:
  - The [key](#key) or [seed](#seed) is generated using a [Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)](#drbg) that conforms to [NIST SP 800-90A](http://http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf), and has been seeded with at least two separate cryptographically secure sources of [entropy](#entropy) that have been combined in a cryptographically secure manner (e.g. SHA256[UnguessableFactor1 + UnguessableFactor2]). NIST SP 800-90A is a standard that ensures that deterministically-generated numbers follow a random distribution with respect to a deterministic seed. Thus, the ability to determine these random numbers is reducible to the ability to discover the DRBG's seed.
  - The Dual_EC DRBG from NIST SP 800-90A has been demonstrated to be [vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG) and should not be used.
  - Optionally, instead of a NIST SP 800-90A compliant DRBG with a combination of two seeds as specified above, the key or seed may also be generated by a Non-deterministic Random Bit Generator (NRBG), or a "True Random Number Generator" (TRNG) that passes industry-standard statistical tests for randomness such as [DIEHARD](http://www.stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard/), Crypt-X, or [NIST STS](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html).
