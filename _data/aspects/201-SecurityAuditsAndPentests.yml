description: >
  This aspect covers third-party reviews of the security systems, technical controls, and policies that protect the information system from all forms of risk as well as penetration tests designed to identify paths around existing controls. Regardless of the technical skills, knowledge, and experience of staff who build and maintain an information system, it has been proven that third-person reviews very often identify risks and control deficiencies that were either overlooked or underestimated by staff. For the same reasons that development companies require different people to test a product from those who write it, different people than those who implement a cryptocurrency system should assess its security. Third parties provide a different viewpoint and are independent of the technical controls and can be objective without risk of retaliation.

level_one:
  - A developer who is knowledgeable about bitcoin security has assisted in the design and implementation of the information system. Having this knowledge available during the design and implementation stages helps ensure best practices are followed to minimize risk.

level_two:
  - A single audit and/or penetration test has been completed by a third-party entity prior to – or shortly after - launch. The audit covered both static and dynamic analysis of source code to ensure secure programming patterns were used wherever applicable, and cryptographic libraries were used properly wherever they have been employed. In addition, documentation shows that all concerns raised by the audit have been addressed by the system’s team in order to remove the concerns from the system. These audits decrease the risks associated with institutional blindness and provide confidence in the organization’s controls and procedures.

level_three:
  - Security audits and/or penetration tests are performed on a defined schedule of at least once per calendar year, and documentation exists that shows how each of the concerns within the audit were addressed. Regular audits/penetration tests not only reduce the risks of unknown deficiencies in security but also reduce the overall cost of security as each audit builds on top of the last one’s results allowing for a more focused and cost effective assessment.
