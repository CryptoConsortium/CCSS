title: Wallet Creation

description: >
  This aspect covers the creation of [wallets](#wallet) or [addresses](#address) that can receive cryptocurrencies. Wallets are created using key signing methodologies that can require a single key’s signature, multiple keys' signatures, or a minimum number of signatures from many keys. Furthermore, wallets can be created individually (commonly referred to as JBOK wallets, or "Just a Bunch Of Keys") or in a deterministic way that allows a set of addresses/key pairs to be created from a single master seed.
  Security of wallet creation is derived from the integrity of the wallet in the face of various risks such as a lost/stolen/compromised key, and the confidentiality of the wallet that would make it difficult to associate a wallet with a particular [actor](#actor).

level_one:
  - Systems that enforce new [addresses](#address) for every transaction implicitly mitigate cases where a compromised [wallet](#wallet) continue to receive funds from actors who are not informed about the compromise as was seen in the days following the BitStamp compromise of early 2015. Since the previously generated addresses will remain valid and there is no way to prevent users from (accidentally or otherwise) sending transactions to old addresses, an automated wallet sweeping system that flushes any funds delivered to the compromised address to a new, secure wallet is recommended in the event of a compromise.

level_two:
  - Any [address](#address) generated by a [wallet](#wallet) must require a minimum of 2 signatures in order to spend funds, where a separate [actor](#actor) holds each signing [key](#key). Requiring 2 or more signatures on a wallet increases the integrity of funds by reducing the risk of theft associated with a compromised key or key holder. This is commonly referred to as a [multi-sig](#multisig) wallet. The actors can either be human or system (i.e. two humans, two systems, or one human and one system) but must be separate entities that each manage their own key for the wallet.
  - Redundant [keys](#key) are assigned to each [wallet](#wallet) for recovery purposes. This ensures that the funds are still available in the event one of the primary keys becomes inaccessible for any reason. One common method of achieving this goal is to create a wallet that requires any 2 of 3 possible signatures in order to spend funds (i.e. there is 1 redundant key)
  - All [addresses](#addresses) are assigned [deterministically](#hd-wallet) based on [seeds](#seed) that are kept private. Using JBOK wallets requires regular backups of each new [key](#key) that is generated which increases the complexity of the system. This raises the risk of human error that can cause disruptions to the business or accidental loss of funds if a backup does not include certain keys. Wallets that are assigned deterministically remove this risk and improve the integrity of the system.
  - Any [keys](#key) that have signing authority on a single [wallet](#wallet) must be stored in different locations. By separating the wallet's keys across multiple locations, the risks associated with localized disruptions to business (i.e. fire, flood, earthquake, break-ins) do not affect the organization's ability to spend funds.

level_three:
  - Unique [addresses](#address) must be generated by the [wallet](#wallet) for every transaction. This enhances privacy by making it more difficult to determine which addresses belong to which [actors](#actor). One of the most common methods of implementing this requirement is to use a [deterministic wallet](#hd-wallet) to generate all addresses.
  - Any [keys](#key) that have signing authority on a single [wallet](#wallet) must be stored by multiple organizational entities. By giving keys to separate legal entities, such as lawyers, accountants, or other businesses, legal risks that can disrupt your business will not necessarily disrupt your funds. Note that this does not violate the Key/Seed Generation level 1 requirement, as the separate organizations fail to meet the definition of an [actor](#actor).
