title: Keyholder Grant/Revoke Policies & Procedures
file: 106-KeyholderGrantRevokePoliciesAndProcedures

category: Cryptographic Asset Management

description: >
  This aspect covers the policies and procedures surrounding granting and revoking access to cryptographic [keys](#key) or [seeds](#seed) that store organizational or end-user funds. Staff typically have greater access to an information system with respect to accessing its information, invoking privilege-restricted actions, and representing the organization to the public. Improper management of the onboarding and offboarding of personnel introduce risks of privileged accounts remaining when staff depart, as well as unrevoked keys that persist [signing](#signature) authority for certain transactions.

level_one:
  - An awareness of how roles should be managed when onboarding or offboarding staff from keyholder positions exists within the organization. A staff member who is knowledgeable about the system is able to ensure that permissions are granted/revoked to/from the affected staff appropriately.

level_two:
  - The organization maintains checklists that cover all tasks that must be completed when staff vacate or transition into keyholder roles within the organization. These checklists have been reviewed by knowledgeable personnel to ensure "least privilege principles" are applied to the information system, as well as necessary access where required. This eliminates the risks associated with missed privileges and the possession of un-revoked [keys](#key).

level_three:
  - The organization's checklists include auditing information that record the identity of the staff member that performs the grant/revoke operations. Each entry within the audit trail is attested to by the staff member who performed that task.
