Regardless of the technical skills, knowledge, and experience of staff who build and maintain an information system, it has been proven that third-person reviews very often identify risks and control deficiencies that were either overlooked or underestimated by staff. For the same reasons that development companies require different people to test a product from those who write it, different people than those who implement a cryptocurrency system should assess its security. Third parties provide a different viewpoint and are independent of the technical controls and can be objective without risk of retaliation.</p>
