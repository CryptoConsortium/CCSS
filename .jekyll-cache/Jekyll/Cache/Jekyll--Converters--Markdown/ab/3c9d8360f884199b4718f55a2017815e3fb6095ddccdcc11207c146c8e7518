I"¼<p>In the context of most cryptocurrencies, a wallet is a public-private keypair, where some encoding of the public key (an <a href="#address">address</a>) can be used in transaction outputs to transfer funds. The private key can then be used to generate a valid signature for a transaction spending those funds. In practice, however, â€˜walletâ€™ usually refers to an application that manages a large number of these keypairs, allowing a new address to be used for each transactions. Wallet applications generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JBOK (Just a Bunch of Keys) Wallets where the wallet uses a <a href="#prng">PRNG</a> to generate each keypair and stores them for use.</li>
  <li><a href="#hd-wallet">HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallets</a> which derives an arbitrary number of keypairs from one random <a href="#seed">seed</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wallet software can introduce additional complexity, for example by combining multiple keypairs into single addresses, as in the case of a <a href="#multisig">multi-signature</a> wallet.
For the purposes of this document, the term â€˜walletâ€™ refers to some <em>collection</em> of cryptocurrency <a href="#address">addresses</a>.</p>
