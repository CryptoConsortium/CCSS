I"±<p>When multiple blocks are found at approximately the same time, it is possible for the blockchain to have multiple tips/heads. Since this is not common with flat files and databases, most programmers that are new to blockchains will write applications that only look at one tip/head of the blockchain and ignore the others. It is possible for these applications to become ‚Äúconfused‚Äù when the tip of a blockchain is ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù or removed during a reorganization (‚ÄúReorg‚Äù) of the blockchain. This can cause transactions that were previously confirmed to become unconfirmed which can lead to unexpected behaviour unless your information system has been built to explicitly handle blockchain reorgs. This behaviour can lead to a loss of funds if not handled appropriately. All information systems that deal with blockchains should be able to handle reorgs in a way that is consistent with the business requirements that govern it.</p>
