I"e<p>Verification of fund destinations and amounts is performed via a <a href="../Definitions#authenticated-communication-channel">Authenticated Communication Channel</a> prior to <a href="../Definitions#key">key</a>/<a href="../Definitions#seed">seed</a> use. This can be performed by humans before using their keys/seeds to ensure theyâ€™re sending the right amount of funds to the right <a href="../Definitions#address">addresses</a>/people/companies, or by systems that perform automated signing by checking destination addresses against whitelists and spending limits before the signature is applied. The implementation of payment protocols that provide <a href="../Definitions#signature">digitally signed</a> addresses, or the use of systems that display images and business names instead of cryptocurrency addresses greatly simplify this verification process.</p>
