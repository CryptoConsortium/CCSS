I".<p>The <a href="../Definitions#key">key</a> or <a href="../Definitions#seed">seed</a> is generated using a <a href="../Definitions#drbg">Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)</a> that conforms to <a href="http://http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf">NIST SP 800-90A</a>, and has been seeded with at least two separate cryptographically secure sources of <a href="../Definitions#entropy">entropy</a> that have been combined in a cryptographically secure manner (e.g. SHA256[UnguessableFactor1 + UnguessableFactor2]). NIST SP 800-90A is a standard that ensures that deterministically-generated numbers follow a random distribution with respect to a deterministic seed. Thus, the ability to determine these random numbers is reducible to the ability to discover the DRBGâ€™s seed.</p>
