I"ã<p>Security audits and/or penetration/vulnerability tests are performed on a defined schedule of at least once per calendar year, and documentation exists that shows how each of the concerns within the audit were addressed. Regular audits/penetration tests not only reduce the risks of unknown deficiencies in security but also reduce the overall cost of security as each audit builds on top of the last oneâ€™s results allowing for a more focused and cost effective assessment.</p>
