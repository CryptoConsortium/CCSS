I"[<p>This aspect covers the information system’s maintenance of audit logs that provide a record of all changes to information throughout the system. In the event of unexpected behaviour or security incidents, audit logs are an extremely valuable tool that can help investigators understand how the unexpected symptoms occurred and how to resolve the inconsistencies to return the information system to a consistent state. The maintenance of audit logs significantly reduce the risks associated with operational awareness and increase the information system’s ability to correct any inaccuracies.</p>
