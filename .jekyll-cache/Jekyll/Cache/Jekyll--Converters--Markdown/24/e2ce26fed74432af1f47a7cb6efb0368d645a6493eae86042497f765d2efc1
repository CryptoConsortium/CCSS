I"><p>A <a href="#wallet">wallet</a> that uses a cryptographically secure key derivation function (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>) to create an arbirtarily large number of unique <a href="#address">addresses</a> from a single master <a href="#seed">seed</a>. These are beneficial as only the master seed needs to be backed up to protect against loss. Some HD wallet software can also support <a href="#multisig">multi-signature</a> configurations where multiple master seeds are combined when creating addresses. HD Wallets generally organize addresses into an n-ary tree structure, where each address is associated with a path through the tree. The first HD wallet standard adopted by many applications in the bitcoin community was <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP32</a> as proposed by Pieter Wuille. <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP44</a> introduced additional functionality allowing sub-paths to be shared without compromising the security of the entire wallet.</p>
