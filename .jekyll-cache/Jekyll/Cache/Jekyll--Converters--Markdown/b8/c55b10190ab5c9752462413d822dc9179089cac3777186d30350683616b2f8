I"œ<p>This aspect covers the existence and use of a <a href="../Definitions#key-compromise-protocol">protocol</a> that dictates the actions that must be taken in the event a cryptographic <a href="../Definitions#key">key</a>/<a href="../Definitions#seed">seed</a> or its <a href="../Definitions#actor">operator/holder</a> is believed to have become compromised. Organizations must be prepared to deal with a situation where a private key has â€“  even potentially â€“  become known, determinable or destroyed. Proper policies and procedures to govern these events decrease the risks associated with lost funds and disclosed trade secrets, and increase the availability of the information system to its users. The lack of a KCP will prevent an organization from achieving Level III certification. Examples of when a KCP would be invoked include the identification of tampering of a tamper-evident seal placed on key material, the apparent disappearance of an operator whose closest friends and family cannot identify their whereabouts, or the receipt of communication that credibly indicates an operator or key is likely at risk of being compromised. The execution of <a href="../Definitions#key-compromise-protocol">Key Compromise Protocols</a> must make use of <a href="../Definitions#authenticated-communication-channel">Authenticated Communication Channels</a> to ensure KCP messages are only sent/received by authenticated actors.</p>
