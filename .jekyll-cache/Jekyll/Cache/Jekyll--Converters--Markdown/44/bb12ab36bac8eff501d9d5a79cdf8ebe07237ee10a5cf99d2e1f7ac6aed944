I",<p>Identity verification is a tiered process by which an organization or system attempts to confirm the authenticity of an <a href="#actor">actors’</a> claim to be a given individual or organization.</p>

<p>Typical methods of identity verification for individuals include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one or more forms of government-issued identification (driver’s license, passport, etc.)</li>
  <li>one or more proofs of residency at the individual’s home (utility bills, bank statements, etc.)</li>
  <li>successful completion of challenge questions through a reputable identity-verification service operating in the individual’s country of residence (e.g. Equifax)</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases of an organization, the supporting records can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employer Identification Number (“EIN”), Business Number, or similar identifier based on jurisdiction</li>
  <li>D-U-N-S Number</li>
  <li>Articles of Incorporation</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, enough supporting documentation should be provided and verified to support the actor’s identity claim.</p>
