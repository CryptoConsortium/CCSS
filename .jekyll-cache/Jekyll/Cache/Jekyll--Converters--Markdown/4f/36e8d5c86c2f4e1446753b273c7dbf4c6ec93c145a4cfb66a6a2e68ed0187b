I"†<p>A system for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encrypting</a> data using an industry-standard encryption or key derivation algorithm with an encryption key or password <em>such that</em> modern cryptanalysis techniques would require the estimated global combined computing power and 1,000x more time than the expected life of the key or seed to decrypt the encrypted data. An example of an encryption algorithm that would provide the necessary level of security at the time of this writing (and potentially for the next few decades barring the discovery of a new attack vector) is AES-256. An example of a password-based key derivation function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> as described <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP 39</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_cryptography">Wikipedia</a></p>
