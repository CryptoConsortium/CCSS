I"Y<p>Tests of the <a href="../Definitions#key-compromise-protocol">Key Compromise Protocol</a> are executed regularly to confirm the viability of the procedures and to ensure staff remain trained to use them in the case of a compromise. Logs of executed tests exist which outline any/all comments of the test. Improvements identified during the tests are written back into the protocol to ensure the most effective and efficient protocol is always maintained. As changes are made to the information system, the Key Compromise Protocol is revisited to assure it is updated with any new class of key.</p>
