I"š<p>A single audit and/or penetration/vulnerability test has been completed by a third-party entity prior to â€“ or shortly after - launch. The audit covered both static and dynamic analysis of source code to ensure secure programming patterns were used wherever applicable, and cryptographic libraries were used properly wherever they have been employed. In addition, documentation shows that all concerns raised by the audit have been addressed by the systemâ€™s team in order to remove the concerns from the system. These audits decrease the risks associated with institutional blindness and provide confidence in the organizationâ€™s controls and procedures.</p>
