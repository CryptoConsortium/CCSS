I"è<p>When a blockchain ends up with two persistent tips - with neither being orphaned - the single chain becomes split into two independent blockchains with a shared common history. Forks can occur through intentional changes to consensus rules, or as a result of an accidental divergence of consensus. In either case, there may not be any ‚Äúreplay protection‚Äù for transactions intended for one side of the fork. This can cause a transaction to accidentally transfer more funds than intended. All information systems that deal with blockchains should be able to handle forks in a way that is consistent with the business requirements that govern it.</p>
