I"²<p>This aspect covers the generation of <a href="../Definitions#key">cryptographic keys</a> and <a href="../Definitions#seed">seeds</a> that will be used within a cryptocurrency system. The secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds requires two things to be secure: confidentiality and un-guessable numbers. Confidentiality is required to ensure that the newly created keys or seeds are not read/copied by an unintended party. Un-guessable numbers are required to ensure the newly created key cannot be guessed or determined by an unintended party. Each of the goals listed below provide assurance that the keys and/or seeds are created in a confidential and un-guessable manner.</p>
