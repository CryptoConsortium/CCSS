I"v<p>Digital <a href="../Definitions#signature">signatures</a> must use a ‘k’ value that is never repeated. This can be accomplished through the use of a <a href="../Definitions#drbg">deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)</a> that is compliant with <a href="http://http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf">NIST SP 800-90A</a>, or a deterministic scheme compatible with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979">RFC 6979</a>. Using strong sources of <a href="../Definitions#entropy">entropy</a> is required in order to prevent “dirty signature” vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to recover the private key that was used to compute the signature. A common implementation of this is to use the <a href="../Definitions#prng">pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)</a> supplied by popular operating systems, or an RFC 6979-compatible scheme.</p>
