I"È<p>(stub) A cryptographic key is an input to a cryptographic function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28cryptography%29">Wikipedia</a> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a> a public key is used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted using a corresponding private key. Similarly, the private key can be used to generate irreproducible <a href="#signature">signatures</a> for arbitrary data which the public key can verify. In cryptocurrency, a private key may often include additional application-specific information such as bitcoinâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#user-content-extended-keys">chain code</a>. In such cases, the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code> can apply to extended key information OR partial information which might be used to reconstruct a full key as both are sensitive, private information.</p>
