Following the 2021 Q1 meeting of the steering committee, a number of proposed changes from the community were discussed and integrated into CCSS.  The following topics were addressed in this update:

* Unique Address Requirement removed 
* Deterministic wallet requirement removed
* Wording added to state CCSS covers an effective period of time and is not a point in time assessment.
* Documentation requirements added for internal policies related to key/seed generation, wallet creation, key usage and key compromise protocol.
