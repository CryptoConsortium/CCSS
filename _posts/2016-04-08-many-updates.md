Following the 2016Q1 meeting of the steering committee, a number of proposed changes from the community were discussed and integrated into CCSS.  The following topics were addressed in this update:

* EMP and environmental protection of stored keys
* Entropy pools during key creation
* A FAQ that lists ancilliary risks that are not directly under the scope of CCSS (i.e. fork handling, dust transaction handling, etc.)
* Authenticated communication channels
